Title: A propos


## Our goals

This website intends to aggregate ressources in web technologies and science, and how those two last interact. Authors will be invited to contribute, but spontaneous contributions dealing with the magazine scop will be welcome!

Please note that, [ScienceToWeb](http://www.sciencetoweb.com) ressources will belong to the original authors and not to this website. As we only aggregate ressources, this website content may be a copy an author original post.
